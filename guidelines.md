## Some guidelines to stick to for structure: <3


# Work in branches 

# Add comments describing your code
This is really helpful for the ones who didn't write it to understand, but also nice for yourself so you can understand your own code when getting back to it later lol. 

# We should try to stay true to the naming conventions, and --> don't be afraid of writing long names <-- 
I am very much guilty if this and in the last module I learned how hard it is to debug when everything is named similarly.
The more descriptive the easier it will be for us to understand or own code and especially the ones we didn't write. 

# Use tailwind
If you look in the tailwind.config.js file i have made a variable called "accent" assigned to a color, and then i assigned that classname to the rebel--rebel title.

If we stick to creating variables like this instead of using colors directly in the classnames we can easily and very fast adjust all the elements assigned to the color "accent" by just changing it in the file! 
This will be very useful when we get the last minute changes from UX haha.

Tip --> download Tailwind Fold in vscode 

Documentation: Everything is named slightly different, search for the css line you are looking to use here  https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color and you will get a list of the classnames you can use. 



## Tips from the code quality class 
- Rather have a lot of small components than a few big ones 
- Error handling using try and catch
